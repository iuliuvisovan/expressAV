      "content": "Aurelia Vişovan was born on June 30, 1990 in Sighetu Marmaţiei, in Romania. She started to study piano at the age of 5, in her birth town, under the guidance of Prof. Monica Chifor. From the very beginning she felt very at ease on stage, which led her to take part, from the age of 6, in national and international competitions, winning more than 20 1st prizes. In 2002 she already performed her first concert as a soloist with an orchestra. Continuing to take part in competitions in Romania and abroad, she became a well-known young pianist in Romania and got the chance to play recitals and concerts in her native country. At the age of 12 she moved to Cluj-Napoca, a cultural center of Romania, where she continued her piano studies with Prof. Gerda Türk, and in 2008 she entered the “G.Dima” Music Academy in the same city, where she benefited from the guidance and support of Prof.Adriana Bera. In June 2011 she was accepted at the University for Music and Previousrforming Arts in Vienna, where she is currently studying with Prof. Martin Hughes."

A very passionate chamber musician, in 2009 she becomes a scholar of the SoNoRo-Interferenţe Chamber Music project, which gave her the opportunity to work and play with internationally renowned young musicians and to perform in the SoNoRo Chamber Music Festival in Bucharest. Her adaptability and her speed of adjusting in different groups and music styles made her soon very requested in Vienna, too, where she had the chance to work under the guidance of great musicians, such as Natalia Gutman, Pavel Vernikov, Johannes Meissl or the members of the Altenberg Trio. A very important role in her artistic development played her taking part in many workshops and masterclasses held by renowned musicians, such as Boris Berman, Akiko Ebi, Dang Thai Son, Stephen Hough, Andrzej Jaśinski, György Kurtág or Robert Levin."
